# Custom markup block

This simply provides a Drupal 8 block that renders the markup added when adding the block.
The benefit with this is the markup gets added to config rather than entity content (block types).

## Uses

Maybe you want a block of static text, which is not intended to be edited by content editors and you want
the text in config so it can be version controlled and deployed.

## Requirements

Drupal 8

## TODO

Add Token support.
